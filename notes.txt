direct state access (so no more glBind)
bufferstorage (so no more glSubData, change memory from the pointer directly)
sparse bindless texture arrays (optimize texture bind calls)
buffer fragment (rather that buffer per object, share ubo's for many objects) + persistent mapping
for large amounts of data in shaders use SSBO (shader storage buffer object)
ARB_multi_draw_indirect (to optimize draw calls validation when nothing changes (?))
ARB_shader_draw_parameters (adds gl_DrawID to shaders, which command of multi_draw is executed)

todo:
- gltf model, animation
- ecs
- physics, collisions
- embedded shaders (with uniforms defined by code, only real practical operations defined by shaders)
- framebuffer
- physically based rendering
- terrain generation
- imgui debugging
